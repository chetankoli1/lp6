# BUSSINESS INTELEGENCE
[1.Import the legacy data from different sources such as ( Excel , Sql Server, Oracle etc.) and 
load in the target system. ( You can download sample database such as Adventure works, 
Northwind, foodmart etc.)](BI/latacydata.md)

[2.Perform the Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL) process to construct the database 
in the Sql server](BI/ETL.md)

[3.Create the cube with suitable dimension and fact tables based on ROLAP, MOLAP and HOLAP model.](BI/ROLAP.md)

[4.Import the data warehouse data in Microsoft Excel and create the Pivot table and Pivot Chart](BI/pivottableandchar.md)

[5.Perform the data classification using classification algorithm. Or Perform the data clustering 
using clustering algorithm.](BI/classificationalgo.md)

# SOFTWARE DEFINE NETWORK

[1.Prepare setup for Mininet network emulation environment with the help of Virtual box and Mininet. Demonstrate the basic commands in Mininet and emulate different custom network topology(Simple, Linear, and Tree).View flow tables.](SDN/mininetsetup.md)

[2.After studying open source POX and Floodlight controller, Install controller and run custom topology using remote controller like POX and floodlight controller. Recognize inserted flows by controllers.](SDN/POXandFloodlight.md)

[3.Create a SDN environment on Mininet and configure a switch to provide a firewall functionality using POX controller.](SDN/SDNandPox.md)

[4.Using Mininet as an Emulator and POX controller, build your own internet router. Write simple outer with a static routing table. The router will receive raw Ethernet frames and process the packet forwarding them to correct outgoing interface. You must check the Ethernet frames are received and the forwarding logic is created so packets go to the correct interface.](SDN/mininetemulatorandpox.md)

[5.Emulate and manage a Data Center via a Cloud Network Controller: create a multi-rooted tree-like (Clos) topology in Mininet to emulate a data center. Implement specific SDN applications on top of the network controller in order to or chestrate multiple network tenants within a data center environment, in the context of network virtualization and management](SDN/DataCenterViaCloudNetwork.md)

[6.Study Experiment: Study in details Cloud seeds automates IAAS using SDN and a highperformance network from Juniper SDN Framework.](SDN/IAASusingSDN.md)
